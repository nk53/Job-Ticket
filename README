This is a project that I am doing for a class. It is not part of the project to put it on GitHub, but I figured I should
have a better version-controlling method than just using vim on the live server.

The project is a Job Ticket system, which means that a user (with an account) can request a job to be performed, manage
who is assigned to a job, and/or record work performed for the job (depending on the user's permission level).

I am quite aware that it is not very secure. I would be using PEAR libraries, but I am not in the sudoers file, so I
cannot add Auth or DB_DataObject.
